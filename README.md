# SwiftMatrix

This is a friendly fork from https://github.com/laaksomavrick/swift-matrix, but in this case it complies with Swift Package Manager and also works on Linux. Not at all finished, as it still spits a few out of bound characters. It works, however. This is an experiment on `ncurses` with Swift.
